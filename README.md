# Final-Project

#SUMMARY
The goal of my project is to successfully code an interactive sketch in Framer.js. I've chosen Framer over Processing because Framer has an export/sharing system through links on the Internet that will allow me to access my project on an iPad (for example). 
My inspiration is OpArt or Optical Illusion Art. I originally thought to recreate one of Bridget Riley's pieces, but then decided to utilize techniques to create my own pattern with basic shapes and animation. The user will be able to interact with the sketch using a finger: swiping, tapping, pressing, releasing, etc. 

#COMPONENT PARTS
I will be using coffeescript on Framer.js

#CHALLENGES 
In my mind, there are three steps to my final project. First, I need to settle on a shape and get it to do what I want. That will be the first challenge, as there are many options to pull from and I imagine it will be weird getting used to Framer's code again. Second, is the replication stage. This will be difficult because the picture needs to come together on the broad scale. Third, I'll need to step back and look at it. I probably will spend a lot of time tinkering with small details and trying to make it come together as an acceptable final piece. The most time-consuming part will probably be figuring out the composition.

#TIMELINE
I want to get the basic shapes and structure of my final project down the first week, week and a half. Then, I expect to spend at least two weeks replicating everything. Finally, I'll do finetuning.
