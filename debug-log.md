(1) In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected. 
(2) In a sentence, explain the observed behavior. 
(3) Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch: what part of your code or what part of your circuit is behaving in a way you don't expect? 
(4) Test your hypothesis: what action can you take to help you determine if your hypothesis is true? 
(5) What is the result of your test? 
(6) Repeat steps iii-v above until you resolve your "bug". 

------------------------------
This debug-log is not as relevant to me this week.

ENTRY 1 (Nov 16): 
I expected that arrows would be limited in their range of interactive capabilities. A mouse hovering would cause movement in a single direction. A mouse clicking... Arrows are angular shapes that allow the screen to be taken over. I mean to say that a background with arrows would contain more shapes than a background with rectangles of the same size. However, though I was planning to move on in my experimentations with squares and trianges, I then decided to switch to circular shapes. I believe they have an inherent appeal to users, especially if they animate, and I will consider transforming them from circles to squares...

------------------------------

ENTRY 2 (Nov 25):
I decided to stick with the arrows. I thought the program might be able to handle each individual arrow as a vector, but I ended up using strips of arrow shapes. I guess Framer.js couldn't handle so much code. 


ENTRY 3 (Nov 25):
Framer works differently from Processing or Arduino. In the code, the indents make a huge difference. I spent some time trying to debug my code when all it was freaking out over was an extra or absent indent.


ENTRY 4 (Nov 25):
The coding language is a bit confusing. I think it's restricting my project. 
On another note, I've decided to create another pattern besides the arrows.

------------------------------

ENTRY 5 (Nov 30):
There are some default properties on Framer that I'm not familiar with. Because they're default, sometimes I can't tell if the animations I put in manually are working or not. 

ENTRY 6 (Nov 30):
I've chosen squares as the shape for my second animation, but two different shapes of them.

ENTRY 7 (Dec 4):
When I tried to connect the pieces together, they didn't fit perfectly. I was also using a white background, so it didn't occur to me that I was missing some white vectors. 

------------------------------

ENTRY 8 (Dec 6):
Framer doesn't recognize a layer named "orange 2." It sees "orange" and "2" as separate beings. My code refused to work until I changed the layer named to "orange2."

ENTRY 9 (Dec 6):
I still haven't figured out when indents are important and when they're not. Luckily, Framer has a function that points out what the problem is.

ENTRY 10 (Dec 6):
Framer doesn't have if/else/while/etc. statements like Processing does. Trying to get around that is somewhat taxing. In some ways the jargon is more intuitive, but there are some functions that are not covered in tutorials...

ENTRY 11 (Dec 7):
My images are jaggedy in this second piece. It's messing with the accuracy of the color changes, but there's not much I can do about it.
