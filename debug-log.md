(1) In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected. 
(2) In a sentence, explain the observed behavior. 
(3) Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch: what part of your code or what part of your circuit is behaving in a way you don't expect? 
(4) Test your hypothesis: what action can you take to help you determine if your hypothesis is true? 
(5) What is the result of your test? 
(6) Repeat steps iii-v above until you resolve your "bug".

This debug-log is not as relevant to me this week.

ENTRY 1: 
I expected that arrows would be limited in their range of interactive capabilities. A mouse hovering would cause movement in a single direction. A mous clicking... Arrows are angular shapes that allow the screen to be taken over. I mean to say that a background with arrows would contain more shapes than a background with rectangles of the same size. However, though I was planning to move on in my experimentations with squares and trianges, I then decided to switch to circular shapes. I believe they have an inherent appeal to users, especially if they animate, and I will consider transforming them from circles to squares...
